⭐ Valorant Instalocker (Electron)

A clean and simple Valorant Instalocker built with Electron, designed to instantly lock your chosen agent as soon as the agent select screen appears. This project focuses on speed, ease of use, and a smooth interface, allowing players to lock in their main agent without wasting any time. It’s created for learning, experimentation, and demonstration purposes only.

This tool does not modify Valorant files, does not interact with Vanguard, and does not bypass any protection systems. It works only on the user side by automating basic actions in a minimal and safe manner.

🚀 Overview

At the start of every match, Valorant requires players to choose an agent quickly. Some players prefer to instantly lock their main without being outpicked by others. This application automates that process and ensures your selected agent is locked in immediately when the selection phase begins.

The app includes a simple UI, agent selection options, and smooth performance thanks to Electron’s lightweight structure.

🧩 How It Works

The instalocker waits for the agent select phase and automatically locks the agent you selected in the application. It uses basic UI automation concepts and does not access or manipulate any protected game files. Everything happens on the user side, making it suitable for educational use and code exploration.
